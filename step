Stop the MariaDB Service:
First, stop the MariaDB service to ensure no database operations are occurring during the move.

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
Create a New Directory:
Create a new directory in /home where you want to store the MariaDB data.

sh
Copy code
sudo mkdir /home/mysql
sudo chown mysql:mysql /home/mysql
Copy Existing Data:
Copy the existing database files to the new location.

sh
Copy code
sudo cp -R /var/lib/mysql/* /home/mysql/
sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /home/mysql
Update the MariaDB Configuration:
Update the MariaDB configuration file to point to the new data directory. This file is typically located at /etc/mysql/my.cnf or /etc/my.cnf. Open the configuration file with your preferred text editor.

sh
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
Look for the [mysqld] section and change the datadir option:

ini
Copy code
[mysqld]
datadir=/home/mysql
Save and close the file.
